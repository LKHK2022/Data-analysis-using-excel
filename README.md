# Retail Sales Analysis Project 🛍️📊

Welcome to my **Retail Sales Analysis** project! In this project, I analyzed a retail sales dataset using Excel to gain insights into the performance of different sales transactions. I applied various Excel functions and techniques to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.

## Project Overview 📈

The goal of this project was to analyze sales data for retail transactions. Key tasks included:
- Calculating total sales.
- Analyzing trends in sales and commissions.
- Creating summary reports using PivotTables and PivotCharts.
- Leveraging Excel functions to derive insights.

## Key Excel Functions Used 🧑‍💻

During the project, I utilized the following Excel functions to manipulate and analyze the data:

- `SUM`: To calculate the total of sales and commissions.
- `AVERAGE`: To find the average sales value across different periods.
- `UNIQUE`: To identify unique products or categories in the dataset.
- `VLOOKUP`: For matching product names with their corresponding sales data.
- `SUMIF`: To sum sales data based on specific conditions.
- `SUMIFS`: For summing sales across multiple conditions.
- **Cell Referencing**: Used for creating dynamic calculations.
- **PivotTables**: To summarize sales data and group by categories.
- **PivotCharts**: For visualizing the summarized sales data.
- **Slicers**: To add interactivity to the PivotTables and PivotCharts.

## Key Features ✨

- **Commission & Total Sales Columns**: I created new columns for commission and total sales using Excel formulas to calculate commissions based on predefined percentages and sum up total sales.

## Other Projects 🌍

In addition to this project, I've worked on a few other interesting datasets:

1. **Biggest Atlantic Hurricanes** 🌪️
   - This project analyzes data related to the biggest hurricanes in the Atlantic, using the dataset `Biggest Atlantic Hurricanes starter.xlsx`. The goal was to uncover patterns and trends in the severity, frequency, and impact of these hurricanes.

2. **Bike Sales Dataset** 🚴‍♂️
   - This project focuses on analyzing a dataset related to bike sales. I used Excel to explore sales performance, identify the best-selling products, and identify factors influencing sales trends.
